      The College Fest project is a web application that allows users to manage student details for a debate event. 
      The project uses Spring, MVC, and Hibernate ORM to perform CRUD operations on a database table that stores student information.

      Users can insert new records into the table, update existing records, delete records, and print all records from the table. 
      The project also includes a security layer with two roles: USER and ADMIN.

      Administrators have the privilege of performing all operations, while users can only view and save student details.

      Overall, the College Fest project provides a user-friendly interface for managing student information, with robust security features 
      
      to protect sensitive data.
